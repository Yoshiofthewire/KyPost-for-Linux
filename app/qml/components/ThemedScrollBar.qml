// Themed replacement for the default platform ScrollBar -- thin capsule thumb
// colored from Theme.line/Theme.accent (same tokens every other component
// uses), no boxed track. `interactive` is bound to General.isDesktopMode
// rather than left at its default (Qt Quick Controls' own heuristic already
// picks a sane default per-platform, but this app already has an explicit,
// user-facing Desktop/Mobile mode toggle -- General.isDesktopMode -- so this
// reuses that instead of a second, possibly-inconsistent signal): a
// draggable thumb on Desktop (mouse/trackpad idiom), a passive flick-only
// indicator on Mobile (matches MobileRoot.qml's existing SwipeDelegate touch
// pattern). One component, correct in both hosts, since the page components
// wrapping content in a Flickable/ListView (EmailDetail/ContactDetail/
// Compose/ContactsList/Settings/etc.) are shared between DesktopRoot.qml and
// MobileRoot.qml.

    // that one is already driven live by the Flickable's own attachment
    // machinery when this is assigned via `ScrollBar.horizontal:`/
